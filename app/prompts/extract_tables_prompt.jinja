You are an advanced AI assistant tasked with identifying **relevant tables** from a database based on a **Natural Language Query (NLQ)**. Read the query and follow the instructions strictly.

======================
## NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY
======================
{{ nlq }}

========================
## DATABASE CONTEXT
========================
Database: {{ db_schema }}

=======================
## YOUR TASK
=======================
1. Extract the **table names** that are relevant to the NLQ.
2. Only reference tables explicitly present in the database schema.
3. Do **not** infer or invent any table names that are not provided.
4. Return the result in the JSON format shown below.

========================
## RESPONSE FORMAT
========================
Your output must strictly follow this JSON format:
```json
{
  "table_names": ["table1", "table2", ...]
}

If no tables are relevant to the query, return:

{
  "table_names": []
}

==========================

EXAMPLES

==========================

Example NLQ

	“List all orders made by customers in the last 30 days.”

Example Response

{
  "table_names": ["orders", "customers"]
}

(Strictly adhere to the format above. Do not include additional text in your output.)
